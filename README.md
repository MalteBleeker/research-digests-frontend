# Research-Digests-Frontend

A platform that lets users generate accessible research article short versions and share them with the public.

Note: For the complete functionality, it also requires a deployment of the "research-digests-backend".

User-Flow:
1. Sign Up & Drag/Drop a PDF of a research article
2. Adjust the automatically generated summary as needed.
3. Adjust the automatically generated title and thumbnail as needed.
4. Add the full reference to the original article (automatically, via DOI, or manually).
5. Publish.

The article short versions are then visible in the feed of other users.
More advanced RL based recommendations could be implemented with a system such as the "research-article-recommender".
